# hello-world
New to this? Yes. Always? Probably. Brain don't fail me now.

I am new to developing software this millenium but am an old hat at it from way back. (basic, pascal, fortran, etc.)
Right now I am really focused on learning R or other equivalent coding methods to be a better person overall.
